    <h1>Kabaddi</h1>
    <p><img src='Nepal-kabaddi.jpeg' /><br>Kabaddi is a contact team sport played between two teams of seven players each. The objective of the game is for a single player on offense, referred to as a "raider", to run into the opposing team's half of a court,
        tag out as many of their defenders as possible, and return to their own half of the court, all without being tackled by the defenders, and in a single breath. Points are scored tagged by the raider, while the opposing team earns a point for stopping
        the raider.

        <p> Players are taken out of the game if they are tagged or tackled, but are brought back in for each point scored by their team from a tag or tackle. It is popular in the Indian Subcontinent and other surrounding Asian countries. Although accounts
